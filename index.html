      <h2>IMPORTANT NEWS FOR UPCOMING SEASON 2019/20</h2>

      <p class= "intro">To all Iveagh Youth branch members and other One United members wishing to become members of our branch.</p>
        
      <p class="intro">News as to how the branch will be run this season is as follows:</p>
      
      <p>The first time the branch will be taking names and deposits for all games up the end of the season. This will also apply to people who wish to make their own travel arrangements and apply for <a href="/tickets/">ticket only</a>. Priority for those games most in demand will be decided by the support shown to Man United and the branch</p>

      <p>For the Man Utd v Liverpool game a ballot is being run and funds raised will be used to provide family priced trips where a lower price for children will be available. Names to contact for booking trips, ticket only and books of ballots will be shown at the end of the post.</p>

      <p>We are in the process of upgrading the rooms in the hotels we use to executive rooms and we have acquired some grade 1 season tickets for the new season. We are also in the process of adding a new 4-star hotel to our accommodation list</p>

      <p>It is our intention, if possible, to retain the very inexpensive pricing structure that has been available to our members for the past number of years, and of course we will remain 1 of the few if not only branches that do not enforce any form of dues. </p>

      <p>Free entry to various competitions to win Manchester United memorabilia and free tickets for games will be available for all those who share and promote all branch news on their social media platforms. Further news to follow!</p>

      <p>Anyone wishing to know more about the branch, it’s voluntary and charity work, or any of the points above should contact the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gerry Mulgrave: <b>07808 058401</b>   </li>
